        <h2>Hector Cave House</h2>
        <p>Hector Cave House, carved into the unique caldera cliff for more than 250 years, was originally used as a wine cellar.Then
          It became a family owned house, which then opened its doors to share its unique character to travelers from around
          the world.</p>

        <p>Really amazing place to stay! My wife and I enjoyed every part of our stay at Giannis's place. Dana and Dimitri were
            also amazing, they helped us with our luggage, gave great recommendations, and helped with anything we needed. The
            place has incredible views, location and was extremely comfortable. We'll be back for sure, and will be staying at
            any of Giannis's places. Thanks for the amazing stay Giannis!</p>
            <p>We loved our stay at the cave house. The location and the house itself are both incredible and Giannis is a very welcoming host. He even helped us set up some activities and tours while on the island and provided a fantastic list of recommendations. Can't wait to come back!</p>

            <h3>Hosted by Giannis</h3>
            <p>Hi there, I am Giannis, I grew up in Athens and after studying and working abroad (UK and Switzerland) for 5 years,I
              decided to come back in Greece and work for a family business. In 1998 my parents visited Santorini Island and they
              fell in love with Oia village where they bought those picturesque cave houses… Since then all about my summer vacations
              is to lay back at that terrace and admire the spectacular view. Traveling is to share… There is no better way of
              doing this, other than sharing the experience with other travelers. Of course I will not lose any chance to discover
              unique destinations like Santorini around the world… </p>

            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p> Giannis’s home is located in Oia, South Aegean, Greece. Hector Cave house is situated in a very convenient location,
                right on the main path of Oia traditional settlement. Within walking distance, visitors can reach all the highlights
                of Oia and wonder around picturesque shops, cozy restaurants and romantic caldera-view cafes. Also, the house lies
                a few steps from the old castle and the best viewing spot for the famous Oia sunset. Although close to local activity,
                the house provides peacefulness and privacy, allowing guests to relax and enjoy the marvelous view from the terrace.</p>
